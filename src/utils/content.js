    questionOne:
      {
        question:'Who are we?',
        answer:`
        We are a technology startup intent on
        employing a global approach and a local
        understanding to solving farming challenges.
        Based in Mauritius, but with projected
        operations in the Rwandan and African
        market, we are assembling a team of
        stakeholders and team players to bring to
        market products that embody the Agriculture
        4.0 concept.
        `
    },

    questionTwo:
      {
        question:'What problem are we solving?',
        answer:`
        The problem we are attempting to solve is straightforward but profound. 
        Farmers and food gardeners suffer enormous losses when their resources and efforts are directed toward 
        farming practices with many unknown variables, such as appropriate soil content, weather patterns, and
         their variability, resulting in unproductivity, low and poor yield, and an increasing rate of seed death.
          Furthermore, it is difficult to detect and assess these conditions quickly or to obtain personalized timely 
          information on them prior to sowing season, particularly when farms are located far from research centers.

        `
    },
    questionThree:
      {
        question:'How are we tackling this problem? ',
        answer:`
        We are building the dotTerra AI. With this, we will assess, monitor, and predict critical farming system 
        resources (soil content, water, weather, etc.) as it operates and advise on measures to solve them before 
        they become a problem to prevent immense losses and poor farming practices. We will also proactively detect 
        important changes in the agro-ecosystems as soon as they occur. All these are done within milliseconds to give
         farmers a head start in mitigating issues otherwise heavily consequential risks. As a result, the farmer becomes 
         proactive to maximize and optimize yields rather than reactive.
        `
    },
    
    questionFour:
      {
        question:'What do we need from you?',
        answer:`
        We are keen on employing a local approach to our intervention.
        We believe that consumer insight should play a significant role in influencing a
        productâ€™s dynamic. We are currently building the Minimum Viable Product iteration
        of the dot Terra AI. We would love to work with you, to prove the concept of our
        product.
