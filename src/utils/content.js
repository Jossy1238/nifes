        The Nifes Alumni Community was founded on a bright and sunny day in June 1985.
        It all began with a handful of dedicated Nifes alumni who shared a vision 
        of creating a strong and connected network. Over the years, this community has grown, 
        evolved, and thrived, uniting alumni from diverse backgrounds and generations. 
        Today, we stand as a testament!
